Contributions:
1) Created grahql query to get block list and transaction data associated with block. 
2) Developed component to display list of blocks with a particular timestamp(This was done to simplify the volume of data displayed). The table displays details like height,transaction count,fees, size. 
It is similar to the functionality here- https://explorer.btc.com/btc/blocks.
3) Added css code to display the list of blocks.
4) Added playwright test cases to make sure that the table is displayed correctly.
