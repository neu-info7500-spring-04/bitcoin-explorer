* Blockchain Data Sourcing: Utilized the Bitquery API and GraphQL to accurately source real-time blockchain data from the Bitcoin testnet. This approach ensured that our application had access to timely and accurate blockchain information, serving as a solid foundation for data-driven features.
* User Interface Development: Leveraged React's component-based architecture to develop a table view that dynamically updates with new blocks as they are added to the blockchain. 
* Styling and Design: Employed Ant Design for crafting the styling and design elements of the table view.
